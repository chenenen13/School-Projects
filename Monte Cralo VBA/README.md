## In this project, we want to estimate the value of ln (2) by two different methods: Monte Carlo and Riemann.

Firstly, we are going to explain what Monte Carlo and Riemann Method is; then we will explain the code that we implemented on VBA; finally, we are going to compare these two methods by plotting their convergence in function of number of iteration or subdivision.

**Monte-Carlo method**: Unlike a normal forecasting model, Monte Carlo Simulation predicts a set of outcomes based on an estimated range of values versus a set of fixed input values. In other words, a Monte Carlo Simulation builds a model of possible results by leveraging a probability distribution, such as a uniform or normal distribution, for any variable that has inherent uncertainty. It, then, recalculates the results over and over, each time using a different set of random numbers between the minimum and maximum values. In a typical Monte Carlo experiment, this exercise can be repeated thousands of times to produce many likely outcomes.
Monte Carlo Simulations are also utilized for long-term predictions due to their accuracy. As the number of inputs increase, the number of forecasts also grows, allowing you to project outcomes far- ther out in time with more accuracy. When a Monte Carlo Simulation is complete, it yields a range of possible outcomes with the probability of each result occurring.


**Riemann method**: In mathematics, a Riemann sum is a certain kind of approximation of an integral by a finite sum. One very common application is in numerical integration, i.e., approximating the area of functions or lines on a graph, where it is also known as the rectangle rule. It can also be applied for approximating the length of curves and other approximations.
The sum is calculated by partitioning the region into shapes (rectangles, trapezoids, parabolas, or cubic) that together form a region that is like the region being measured, then calculating the area for each of these shapes, and finally adding all these small areas together. This approach can be used to find a numerical approximation for a definite integral even if the fundamental theorem of calculus does not make it easy to find a closed-form solution. Because the region by the small shapes is usually not the same shape as the region being measured, the Riemann sum will differ from the area being measured. This error can be reduced by dividing up the region more finely, using smaller and smaller shapes. As the shapes get smaller and smaller, the sum approaches the Riemann integral.
