# Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This project is an in-depth exploration of time series analysis in econometrics, designed for Master 1 students. It focuses on dynamic models, unit root tests, and ARIMA modeling using R.

## Key Sections

- **Data Settings and Unit Root Tests**: Initial data preparation and identifying seasonal patterns.
- **Unit Root Tests**: Implementing tests like Augmented Dickey Fuller, Phillips and Perron, and KPSS.
- **Modeling**: Discussing ARMA frameworks for dynamic retail sales modeling.
- **ARIMA Model Estimation**: Applying ARIMA to real-world datasets, such as stock prices.
- **Zivot and Andrews Test Introduction**: A new approach to unit root testing considering structural breaks.
- **Business Cycle Modeling**: Using econometric techniques to model the monthly credit spread dynamics in the US.

## Tools and Technologies

- **R and R-Markdown**: For data analysis, modeling, and reporting.
- **Econometric Methods**: Emphasis on ARIMA, unit root tests, and handling non-stationary time series.
